I'm a Data Science and Machine Learning researcher pursuing my Master's at the University of Paris Cit√©, specializing in AI for Education and Natural Language Processing. With experience ranging from AI research at Avignon Computer Science Laboratory to educational AI development at Aimigo, I create innovative solutions that bridge cutting-edge research with real-world applications.

My technical expertise spans traditional ML to modern AI technologies including LLMs, RAG systems, and multimodal AI. I'm passionate about tackling complex challenges and always open to research collaborations, internship opportunities, or conversations about the future of AI.
